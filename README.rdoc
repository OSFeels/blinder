== Blinder

This is a work in progress! Of course, what isn't? Essentially, I wanna use this textbook Rails app
to handle RFP collections for SCRC. At some point, I'll have to write a _real_ README.

== TODO

* Add validation for Responses.
* Add OAUTH-y layer for controlling/configuring/accessing the app.
* Style the cfp description, proposal submission form, form response (with edit slug)
* Write, edit, and finalize copy for all the pages
