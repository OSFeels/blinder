## Steel City Ruby 2014 Call for Proposals (CFP)
Hi! This page is here to provide you some information about our process for gathering, evaluating, and selecting proposals for talks for this year's Steel City Ruby. Our goal is to select&ndash;objectively and transparently as possible&ndash;the best proposals from those submitted for this year's event.

### What's _best_ mean?
That is a good question. In the context of this year's event, _best_ means most appealing, useful, and relevant to our attendees. While those terms are subjective, we've modeled our selection process to help eliminate biases and encourage open, honest discussion and evaluation based on the comparative merits of the submitted proposals.

### Our Process
SCRC will be considering _Technical_ and _People/Process_ talk proposals separately this year, formalizing the balance we've had and enjoyed in previous years. A single proposal submission can be included in either or both focus areas, and we will select a balance of both presenters and alternates from each group.

The proposal form is divided into four sections, three of which are used as criteria for acceptance. 

_Talk Information_ is the primary data used during proposal evaluation and selection. Please help us to remain as unbiased as possible by not including personally identifying information in this section such as pronouns, websites, or company names. 

_Balancing Information_ is used to provide contextual information about proposals and how they would fit together as a whole conference. There are no wrong answers to these questions!

 _Personal &amp; Contact Information_ is used to make sure of things like one person not doing two talks (it's totally fine to submit more than one proposal but we'll only select one per person).

_Help Us Out_ is not used at any point during the talk selection process, but if you're selected, it will help us immensely with things like ordering t&#45;shirts and updating the SCRC website.

Here's the basic timeline of how we will move from collecting proposals to announcing the conference lineup:

1. __Open &amp; Publicize the CFP:__ The CFP opens __Thursday, 13 March 2014__. We will accept proposals through the end of __Saturday, 19 April 2014__ (11:59pm Eastern Time).

1. __Evaluate blinded proposals__: After collection ends, we will begin reviewing submitted proposals. The review process is arranged in three distinct phases. During the first phase, reviewers will have access only to the _Talk Information_ portion of the proposal responses. A subset of the submitted proposals will advance to the second round, in which the _Balancing Information_ section will become visible to reviewers. From there, the selection committee will narrow the pool further and make their final selections for presenters and alternates, using the  _Personal &amp; Contact Information_ to make sure no one has two talks.


1. __Contact everyone:__ We will reach out to selected presenters and alternates to confirm their inclusion. We will also contact submitters not selected as a presenter or alternate so that no one is left guessing.

1. __Finalize and release lineup:__ Once all of our presenters and alternates have confirmed their participation, we will announce the final presenter lineup on both the SCRC website and Twitter.

### Completing the CFP form
Ok, so you get how the process works. The CFP form is broken into groups that reflect the
blinding levels described above. Required fields are marked with a red asterisk
(<span class="required">*</span>). After you submit your proposal, you'll receive both a browser and email confirmation of your submission. The confirmation contains a unique, private editing url for your proposal; you're welcome to edit your proposal until the CFP closes on __19 April 2014__.

__If you have any problems or concerns with the form or the process, please reach out via email to cfp@steelcityruby.org. That address goes directly to SCRC organizers tasked with ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to participate in this process and who have recused themselves from the blinded rounds of review.__
